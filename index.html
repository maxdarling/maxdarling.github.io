        <p> I am a computer science student at Stanford University, interested in systems and theory. My favorite courses to date are in 
            operating systems and complexity theory, and this quarter I'm excited to explore both distributed systems and pl theory. 
        </p>
        <p> After graduating this spring, I'll be starting work as a software engineer at DoorDash. 
        </p>
        <p>I'm conversationally fluent in Japanese and aspire to live there again for sometime. I've grown to love the 
            country and it's culture via experiences such as interning in Tokyo for a summer, working at a ramen restaurant in my 
            hometown, and consuming lots of literature, anime, and television.
