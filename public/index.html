<p> Hi. My name is Max Darling. </p>
<p> I'm a Senior at Stanford studying Computer Science with a general 
interest systems and theory. 
</p>
<p> This summer I worked for IXL Learning as a full stack developer. It was my 
first exposure to web programming, and I enjoyed it!
</p>
<p> When I'm not coding, I enjoy studying Japanese, reading, playing/watching 
soccer, coming up with new 'fits for my

yoga + meditation.
